## Overview
This repository contains the implementation code of SigTran which is an _efficient_ graph-based method for detecting illicit nodes on blockchain networks. Please refer to our paper for more details. 

### Data
We conducted our experiments on two public datasets including transaction histories of [Bitcoin](https://www.kaggle.com/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set) and [Ethereum](https://www.kaggle.com/xblock/ethereum-phishing-transaction-network) blockchain.

## Acknowledgement
We would like to thank the authors of [RiWalk](https://github.com/maxuewei2/RiWalk) and [node2vec](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec)
for providing open access to the implementation of their methods.
